fun with physics 

Bounce! is a bouncing ball game where users can see the real life laws of physics in action. The box you see on the screen is the area the bouncing balls will be released into, and the user can add or remove them as they wish, speed them up, slow them down, and completely clear the screen. 
Bounce! has been released under the GPL for anyone who wishes to use it, download it, or build upon it. It is and will always be free to all for download. Enjoy it and share it!

--- Instructions ----

As with all source code on GitHub, it needs to be built before use. In order to play this game you will need to have Java installed on your computer and have some way to build it. Eclipse IDE can be used to build these projects with limited success. If you need instructions on building the code please see this link https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Build-Instructions

*Important note: Users with older hardware may see the program lag when the balls are moving extremely fast and there are a lot of them.
